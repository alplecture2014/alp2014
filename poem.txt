The ALP poem 2014
-----------------

Life is hard, full of surprises!
When registration I see fail,
a slight fear (or anger?) rises
about what it might entail.

So I sit waiting for news
from the lecture's team in vain
while dreaming of a sunny cruise
along the shores of Bahrain.

Life is hard, full of uncertainties
and I might get disappointed,
full of stress, full of emergencies,
some things are meant to be avoided.

Oh my god, what stress
this term is a mess.
Exercises tease
a bit more time please! 

My teacher said, "You’re quite a chef.
But still you’re going to get an F.
I didn’t ask for ‘homework stew,’
I said, ‘Tomorrow, homework’s due.’"

Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid. 
I see you lurking there on the periphery of my vision. 
But when I try to look at you, you scurry away. 
Are you shy, squiggly line? 
Why only when I ignore you, do you return to the center of my eye? 
Oh, squiggly line, it's alright, you are forgiven.
“There is no point in using the word 'impossible' to describe something that has clearly happened.”

Sitting at my desk
Wondering what to do next
Maybe I should put my writing skills to test
I don't know what to rhyme with the rest
