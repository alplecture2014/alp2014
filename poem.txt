The ALP poem 2014
-----------------

Life is hard, full of surprises!
When registration I see fail,
a slight fear (or anger?) rises
about what it might entail.

So I sit waiting for news
from the lecture's team in vain
while dreaming of a sunny cruise
along the shores of Bahrain.

Life is hard, full of uncertainties
and I might get disappointed,
when there are no alternatives
to something better left avoided.
