The ALP poem 2014
-----------------

Life is hard, full of surprises!
When registration I see fail,
a slight fear (or anger?) rises
about what it might entail.

So I sit waiting for news
from the lecture's team in vain
while dreaming of a sunny cruise
along the shores of Bahrain.

Life is hard, full of uncertainties
full of stress, full of emergencies,


Oh my god, what stress
this term is a mess.
Exercises tease
a bit more time please!
